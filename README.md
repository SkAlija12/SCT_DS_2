ðŸ“Œ Task 02 â€“ Skillcraft Technology Internship
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Power BI, as part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology.

ðŸ§  Objective
To explore patterns in passenger survival by visualizing and analyzing data features such as gender, passenger class, age, embarkation point, and more.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
Source: Titanic Dataset from Kaggle

Files Used: train.csv (cleaned and transformed)

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Applied
Power BI

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power Query Editor

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Visualization & Dashboard Design

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps
Removed columns: PassengerId, Ticket, Cabin

Filled missing values in Age (median) and Embarked (mode)

Renamed and categorized data types for clarity

âž• New Columns Created
Title: Extracted from Name (e.g., Mr, Miss, Rare, etc.)

FamilySize: Total family aboard = SibSp + Parch + 1

AgeGroup: Binned age into Child, Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Senior

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
Survival Count Visualization

Survival Rate by Gender, Class, Family Size

Age Group Distribution

Passenger Titles Distribution (Pie Chart)

Interactive Slicers for Gender, Class, Embarkation, AgeGroup, Survived

ðŸ–¼ Sample Visual Titles
Main Title: "Survival Insights from the Titanic"

"Survival Rate by Gender"

"Family Size and Survival Count"

"Passenger Titles Distribution"

"Age Group Distribution of Passengers"

ðŸ”š Outcome
This dashboard provides a visual and interactive way to explore the Titanic dataset and understand the influence of various factors on survival. It also helped strengthen practical skills in Power BI, data analysis, and storytelling with data.
